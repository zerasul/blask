# Blask

Blask is a blogging engine based on [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/), that uses MarkDown to show posts. This MicroFramework grants the possibility to create a blog using only MarkDown and HTML.

Using the Flask MicroFramework and the [Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/) template engine, you can easily create a blog with only a few steps.

For Blask to find a new post, all you have to do is write a markdown file and store it in the posts directory.

Example:

    This is an example of *markdown*.

    With this text you can see how _Blask works_.

Once you've written the markdown file, you can view it on your site:

    https://myfancysite.com/hello-world

Before you run the code you have to export the BLASK_SETTINGS enviorement variable.

    :::bash
      export BLASK_SETTINGS= settings.py

Only you need to run the next code:

    :::python
      from Blask import BlaskApp
    
      if __name__== '__main__':
          BlaskApp().run() 

Or You can use the _Blask Command Line Tool_:

    :::bash
      blaskcli run

**Note**: This project is in alpha stage; it is not suitable for production environments.
