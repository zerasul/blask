# About

Blask is a simple Blogging engine that uses the Flask Microframework to render a blog, and uses Markdown to render the post's information. With Blask, it is very easy to create a blog using only HTML and Markdown. Also, the rendering happens dynamically at runtime, so there is no need to generate HTML upfront.

To use Blask, you only need to edit the `settings.py` file to configure the engine with the posts directory, the template
directory, the static assets directory, and, of course, the title of the site.

With the power of the [Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/2.10/) template engine, it is very easy to create a template
 for Blask. All you have to do is write your HTML page and include the `content` variable inside.

Of course, Blask is completely Open Source, and yes! You can improve it, change it and distribute it under the GPL 3.0
license. Also, you can see all the source code and the issues at our [Github Repository](https://github.com/zerasul/blask).

We hope you like Blask, and enjoy using it.
